# ESRGAN-for-Object-Detection
Super Resolution and Object Detection
This repository contains code for performing super-resolution on images using ESRGAN and detecting objects in the processed images using SSD MobileNet V2.

ESRGAN Super Resolution
Overview
The script esrgan_super_resolution.py enhances the resolution of images using ESRGAN (Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Networks).

Usage
Requirements:

Python 3.x
TensorFlow 2.x
Matplotlib
NumPy
Pillow
OpenCV
TensorFlow Hub
Installation:

Clone this repository.
Install the required libraries using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Steps:

Place the image you want to enhance in the specified IMAGE_PATH.
Run esrgan_super_resolution.py.
View the generated high-resolution image and its comparison.
Object Detection using SSD MobileNet V2
Overview
The script object_detection.py uses SSD MobileNet V2 for object detection in images.

Usage
Requirements:

Python 3.x
OpenCV
Installation:

Ensure OpenCV is installed (pip install opencv-python).
Steps:

Provide the image you want to analyze.
Run object_detection.py.
View the detected objects with bounding boxes and labels.
Use Cases:

Image Enhancement: This codebase is valuable for scenarios where image quality improvement or enhancement is necessary. For instance, it can be utilized in photography applications to upscale images without losing quality or in medical imaging for improving the clarity of scans.
Object Recognition and Detection: The object detection module proves beneficial in various domains such as security and surveillance for identifying and tracking objects in real-time, in retail for inventory management through automated object recognition, and in autonomous vehicles for detecting pedestrians, vehicles, and obstacles on roads.
Research and Development: Additionally, this code serves as a starting point for researchers and developers interested in exploring deep learning-based image processing, specifically super-resolution techniques like ESRGAN and object detection using lightweight models like SSD MobileNet V2. Its modular structure allows easy integration into other projects for experimentation and further enhancements.
